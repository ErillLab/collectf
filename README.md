# CollecTF

CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) is a database of transcription factor
binding sites in the Bacteria domain.

This repository contains the source code for the database and web interface.

## Abstract from the [CollecTF paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24234444)

The influx of high-throughput data and the need for complex models to describe
the interaction of prokaryotic transcription factors (TF) with their target
sites pose new challenges for TF-binding site databases. CollecTF
(http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on experimentally validated, naturally
occurring TF-binding sites across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis
on the transparency of the curation process, the quality and availability of the
stored data and fully customizable access to its records. CollecTF integrates
multiple sources of data automatically and openly, allowing users to dynamically
redefine binding motifs and their experimental support base. Data quality and
currency are fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that
encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house validation and
curation of published literature. CollecTF entries are periodically submitted to
NCBI for integration into RefSeq complete genome records as link-out features,
maximizing the visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq
files with regulatory information. Seeking to facilitate comparative genomics
and machine-learning analyses of regulatory interactions, in its initial release
CollecTF provides domain-wide coverage of two TF families (LexA and Fur), as
well as extensive representation for a clinically important bacterial family,
the Vibrionaceae.
