# RefSeq to UniProt accession number mapping

For all RefSeq accession numbers, get their UniProt matches using
[uniprot_tools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uniprot_tools).

For RefSeq accessions with more than one UniProt accession matches, follow steps
below until there is a single matching UniProt accession number.

1. Select the UniProt accession having the same taxonomy ID as the RefSeq
accession. 

2. Select the "reviewed" UniProt accession.

3. Select the UniProt accession having the taxonomy ID that is a match for
reference/representative proteome.

4. Select the UniProt accession having a record that matches to a complete
proteome.
