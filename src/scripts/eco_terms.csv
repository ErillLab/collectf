The first step is to cross-link the protein-DNA complex. This is done using a fixating agent, such as formaldehyde. The cross-linking can later be reversed with heat. Cross-linking kills the cell, giving a snapshot of the bound TF at a given time. The cell is then lysed, the DNA sheared by sonication and the chromatin[2] (TF-DNA complexes) is pulled down using an antibody (i.e. immunoprecipitated). If an antibody for the TF is available, then it is used; otherwise, the TF is tagged with an epitope targeted by commercially available antibodies (the latter option is cheaper, but runs the risk of altering the TF's functionality). Cross-linking is then reversed to free the bound DNA, which is then amplified, labeled with a fluorophore and dumped onto a DNA-array. The scanned array reveals the genomic regions bound by the TF.
