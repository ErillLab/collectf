Please identify a mapping between species in which you work and available
reference genomes in RefSeq (both for the sites and the transcription
factor). This is done by providing RefSeq accession number for the reported
chromosomes (e.g. <code>NC_005363.1</code>; including the version number) and TF
proteins (e.g. <code>Q6GZX3</code>; without version number). Only NCBI RefSeq
accession numbers are accepted.
