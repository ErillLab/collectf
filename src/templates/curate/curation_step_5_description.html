In some cases, especially if using a sequence that is not an exact match to the
reported strain, some sites may not be found using an exact search. In this
case, the CollecTF submission system will use the available evidence to
construct a scoring matrix and search the genome for slightly inexact matches
(up to two mismatches away from the reported site). These will be reported in
the same way as exact matches and you will be asked to validate them in the same
manner.
