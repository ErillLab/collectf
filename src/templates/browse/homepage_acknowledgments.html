CollecTF is based on the collective effort of a fantastic and highly motivated team
of dedicated curators without whom the database would be justâ€¦ well, empty. Check the
<a href="{% url 'curator_roster' %}">curator roster</a> for kudos!

<p>
  Integration with the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">NCBI RefSeq</a>
database is possible thanks to the dedicated effort and infinite patience of Stacy
Ciufo, Tatiana Tatusova and the RefSeq team at
the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Integration with the <a href="http://www.uniprot.org">UniProt Knowledgebase</a>
 is possible thanks to the dedicated effort of Benoit Bely, Maria Martin and the
UniProt development team at the <a href="http://http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Submission of annotations to the <a href="http://geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology</a> is made
  possible by the dedicated effort of Tony Sawford, Melanie Courtot, Claire O'Donovan and the
  UniProt content team at the
  <a href="http://http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  CollecTF uses GO-compliant evidence codes for its curation process, through adoption of the
  <a href="http://www.evidenceontology.org/">Evidence Ontology (ECO)</a>. Integration with ECO is
  made possible by the dedicated effort of Shoshannah Wolfish, Suvarna Nadendla, Marcus Chibucos and
  the ECO team at the
  <a href="http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/">Institute for Genome Sciences</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  CollecTF integrates data from and out-links to many outstanding resources, like the
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene">NCBI Gene database</a>
  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Thanks all for their hard work.
