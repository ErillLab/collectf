    Average Log Likelihood Ratio (ALLR) between two motif columns is the sum of two log-likelihood
    ratios.

      ALLR between two columns $X$ and $Y$ is defined as
      <div class="eq">
        $$
        ALLR(X,Y) = \frac{\sum_{b \in B} n_X(b) \cdot \log{\frac{f_Y(b)}{p(b)}} +
        \sum_{b \in B} n_Y(b) \cdot \log{\frac{f_X(b)}{p(b)}}}
        {\sum_{b \in B} (n_X(b) + n_Y(b))}
        $$
      </div>
      where $B = (A,C,G,T)$, $n_X(b)$ is the count of the base $b$ in column $X$,
      $f_X(b)$ the frequency of base $b$ on column $X$ and $p(b)$ the background probability of base $b$.    
    </p>

    <p>
      The ALLR between two motifs is defined as the sum of the column comparison scores of the ungapped alignment of the two motifs.
    </p>

<p>
  ALLR score histogram for random permutations on the two motifs.  For each test, 100 replicates of
  each motif are obtained by randomly sampling without replacement.  Motif similarity is computed
  using the ALLR statistic.  Blue bars denote frequencies of ALLR values for replicate pair
  comparisons. The red dashed lines corresponds to the ALLR of compared motifs.
