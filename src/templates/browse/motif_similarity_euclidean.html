    Euclidean distance (ED) is the distance between two points in $n$-dimensional space.

        The ED for two DNA motif columns $X$ and $Y$ is defined as
        
        <div class="eq">
          $$
          ED(X,Y) = \sqrt{\sum_{b\in B} (f_X(b)-f_Y(b))^2}
          $$
        </div>
        where $B = (A,C,G,T)$, $f_X(b)$ is the frequency of base $b$ in column $X$.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ED between two motifs is defined as the sum of the column comparison scores of the
        ungapped alignment of the two motifs.

  ED score histogram for random permutations on the two motifs.  For each test, 100
  replicates of each motif are obtained by randomly sampling without replacement.
  Motif similarity is computed using the ED statistic.  Blue bars denote frequencies
  of ED values for replicate pair comparisons. The red dashed lines corresponds to
  the ED of compared motifs.
