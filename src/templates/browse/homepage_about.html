<h1>About CollecTF</h1>

<p>CollecTF, a play on words using the French collectif [collective] and the acronym for
transcription factor [TF], is a database of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the
Bacteria domain.</p>

<p>CollecTF aims at becoming a reference, highly-accessed database by relying on its ability to
customize navigation and data extraction, its relevance to the community, the quality and detail of
the stored data and the up-to-date nature of the stored information.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    CollecTF exclusively stores data on experimentally-validated TFBS and places special emphasis on
    providing a transparent curation process that captures the experimental support for sites as
    reported by authors in peer-reviewed publications.
  </li>

  <li>
    The CollecTF curation model combines direct author submissions and in-house curation. If you
    have data to submit, please do
    <a href="{% url 'homepage_contribute' %}"> contribute</a> it!
  </li>

  <li>
    Reported binding sites are mapped to NCBI RefSeq complete genome records to
    provide genomic context and the experimental process is detailed during
    curation. Curation records are open for inspection. Please,
    <a href="{% url 'homepage_feedback' %}"> let us know</a> if you spot an error.
  </li>

  <li>
    CollecTF focuses on providing fully customizable access to the stored data. The database can be
    browsed by transcription factor families, NCBI taxonomy or experimental support, or through
    customized searches integrating these three elements that allow users to specify the desired
    level of experimental support.
  </li>

  <li>
    CollecTF reports export to common FASTA and flat-file formats, and periodic flat-file releases
    of the database are available for download.
  </li>
 
  <li>
    CollecTF data is periodically submitted to NCBI, where it is integrated into RefSeq complete
    genome records through db_xref links.
  </li>
</ul>
