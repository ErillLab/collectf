A play on words using the French collectif [collective] and the acronym for
transcription factor (TF), CollecTF is a database of prokaryotic transcription
factor binding sites (TFBS). Its main aim is to provide high‐quality,
manually‐curated information on the experimental evidence for transcription
factor binding sites, and to map these onto reference bacterial genomes for ease
of access and processing. The data submitted to CollecTF gets pushed to the NCBI
RefSeq database, where it is embedded as db_xref links in complete genome
sequences, maximizing the availability of the TF‐binding site data and the
impact of the research reported by authors.  This document is a companion guide
for the submission process. The database is accessible at
http://collectf.org. To read more about CollecTF, please see the `NAR paper`_
(PMID: 24234444).
