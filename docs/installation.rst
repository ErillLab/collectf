To setup CollecTF project for development, you need Python 2.7 and the Python
packages in ``requirements.txt``.

It is recommended to install `virtualenv`, a virtual Python environment
builder. `The Python guide`_ has more information why you should consider using
virtual environments.

.. _virtualenv: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
.. _The python guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/
