Welcome to CollecTF's documentation!
====================================

A play on words using the French *collectif* [collective] and the acronym for
transcription factor [TF], CollecTF is a database of prokaryotic transcription
factor binding sites (TFBS). Its main aim is to provide high-quality,
manually-curated information on the experimental evidence for transcription
factor binding sites, and to map these onto reference bacterial genomes for
ease of access and processing. The data submitted to CollecTF gets pushed to
the major biological sequence databases, where it is embedded as *db\_xref*
links, maximizing the availability of the TF-binding site data and the impact
of the research reported by authors.

CollecTF is accessible at `http://www.collectf.org
