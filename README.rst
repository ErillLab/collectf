`CollecTF`_ is a database of transcription factor binding sites in the Bacteria
domain. It aims at becoming a reference, highly-accessed database by relying on
its ability to customize navigation and data extraction, its relevance to the
community, the quality and detail of the stored data and the up-to-date nature
of the stored information.
